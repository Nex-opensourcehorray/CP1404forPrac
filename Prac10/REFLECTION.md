# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

For myself, I will estimate my overall accuracy will lay between 65% - 70%.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Through out the extra exercise and high quality demonstration, it is actually easier for me to imitate, 
absorb the correct method while remaining as a rapidly developing.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

For myself, I believe that it is an opportunity for students to review and re-correct those own coding,
and generate a new reflection and solid the road path on how to precisely create the coding with golden sample.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

As my family member educated since childhood, whether it is a good or bad quality, in turns of 
code-reviewing, asking and responding with pleasant word is useful for the building up a friendly and
harmony relationship between our classmate, which definitely can consist and convert the good condition
to your working time with your colleague.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

The only think I could mentioned is we should respect the diversity of the coding social and reply with
a good manner to ensure that we already complete the communication and do our best effort to influence others.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 05 Feedback](https://github.com/Yuchen513/cp1404practicals/pull/1#issuecomment-2424953228)

### Explanation

This is the first Feedback, therefore most of the Student will do for the first time seriously, and when it reply 
with most of the person, it will remain as politely and responsibility.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 07 Feedback](https://github.com/Winminoo4444/cp1404practicals/pull/4#issuecomment-2467952587)

### Explanation

This Week Prac is very solid, with large amount of modification, and to my surprise, I was able to get a lot guidance
whether for the structure and method, this is something that out of my expectation.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

For the coding and theory learning, I would suggest that the coding sample can be more, because we believe that
the sample code will helping the student to have a fully understand on the method and package, and do a rapidly response 
based on the deep thinking on the coding example.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

For myself, probably the excellent part that I really can mentioned is that those List and method is very clear and 
easily coming out through out my brains, without any extra condition to trigger.
