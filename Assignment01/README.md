# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: mingsen hua

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.

- `places.csv` a data file for you to use.
- `places_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used in your program... it is here as a backup to copy the data
  from if you need it again.

-`a1forTravelTracker.py`, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?

> from the initial, I started the project from Oct 12 at noon, until now(Oct 25th), 
> on average, I spend for more than 3 hours per day, as a result, my estimate spending time
> will be approximately 39-48 hours.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

> It is obviously that all my correction and time allocation is coming to the fixing with
> dataflow changing(especially the printing side), it will be lower sometime if i do the advance
> research on figuring the data transfer, it will save much more time for optimize the function
> performance.
